# Hostel_Management_System
This project is a fully web-based application designed to streamline hostel management processes. 
It enables users to book hostel rooms, check availability,
and manage their preferences conveniently. The system also provides features for hostel administrators to manage
bookings, allocate rooms, and maintain records efficiently. The main aim of this project is to provide an organized
and user-friendly platform for both hostel residents and administrators.
